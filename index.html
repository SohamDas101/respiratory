        <h1>Excretory system in humans</h1>
        <p class="head-top">
        Humans have an elaborate excretory or urinary system to eliminate nitrogenous waste products. It consists of the following parts.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Kidneys</strong> These are a pair of reddish-brown, bean-shaped structures that are located just above the waist on either side of the backbone. They filter the impure blood and produce urine. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Ureters</strong> These are narrow tubes that lead out from each kidney. These tubes carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary
        bladder. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Urinary bladder</strong> It is a pouch-like muscular structure in which urine is stored temporarily. 
        <span class="imp">In an adult male, the average capacity of the urinary bladder varies from 150 to 300 mL.</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Urethra</strong> It is a tube-like openin at the bottom of the urinary     bladder through which urine is passes out.
